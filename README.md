# chromadb bd testing for NOONWIRE project

used openai
working on embeddings
chromadb by default specifies an embedding, so for now we go with the default sentence transformers embedding
chromadb can not be used as the only database for noonwire project, a relational database needs to be available so chromadb can be used to supplement for the machine learning features and others
